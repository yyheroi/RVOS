# **RVOS — A Minimal, Modern RISC-V Operating System written in Contemporary C++**

**RVOS** is a minimal, educational-oriented operating system designed for the RISC-V architecture.
The project is fully implemented using **modern C++ (C++20/23)** with clean abstractions, a focus on clarity, and an emphasis on understanding low-level system behavior.

RVOS aims to provide a compact and comprehensible codebase for exploring:

* Bare-metal RISC-V execution flow
* Low-level hardware initialization
* Memory layout & privilege levels
* Interrupt handling
* Simple kernel infrastructure
* Hardware–software interaction from power-on to running C++ code

It is designed as a personal research project to deepen understanding of operating systems and kernel
